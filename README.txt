Caltech CS2 Assignment 9: Othello

TEAM NAME: Robert'); DROP TABLE students;--
TEAM MEMBERS: Andrew Kang, Robert Eng

Andrew Kang is a magnificent fellow who wrote minimax from week 1, debugged
the negamax algorithm from week 2, and trained little BobbyTables in the ways
of Machine Learning.

Robert Eng got little BobbyTables off the ground right at the beginning by
giving BobbyTables the tools and functions to play the game, albeit randomly.
When BobbyTables grew up a bit, Robert also implemented a broken negamax
algorithm which Andrew fixed.


We did a negamax algorithm. Because we're butts and really busy, we didn't have
time for a full optimization of our code, but anywho, we decided to use
Machine Learning and let BobbyTables hone what parameters he had with the
given oponents. We just need more time to let BobbyTables to truly prosper. We
were going to do an opening book to get him faster early game as well as a
better heuristic which would shift from midgame to lategame.
